Automation of workflow using web tool Yeastriction

## Description:

This python script automates the workflow to extract 2 gRNA's from the Yeastriction web tool (http://yeastriction.tnw.tudelft.nl/). These gRNA's are then used to conduct a restriction digest analysis to find the unique enzymes of the final vector product and then diagnostic primers are designed to target these gRNA's.
